## **Installation**

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shehzadfalcon/react-redux-MUI-starter-kit.git
cd react-redux-MUI-starter-kit
```

```bash
# Using npm

## **Usage**
This boilerplate is designed to be highly customizable and modular. You can easily modify the theme, add new routes, or manage state using Redux Toolkit.

State Management: Redux slices are located in the src/features folder, where you can add your own reducers and actions.
Theming: Customize MUI's default theme in src/theme.js.
Routing: Define your routes in src/App.js using react-router-dom.

## Folder Structure
Here's an overview of the folder structure to help you get started:

---

This structure is designed to separate concerns:

- **public/**: Contains static assets such as the `index.html` file.
- **src/app/**: Contains the global Redux store configuration.
- **src/components/**: Holds reusable components that can be used across different parts of the application.
- **src/features/**: Stores Redux slices (state and reducers).
- **src/pages/**: Contains different views or pages of the app.
- **src/theme.js**: Used for MUI theming and customization.
- **src/App.js**: Main entry point of the app where routes and layout are defined.
- **src/index.js**: Application entry where ReactDOM renders the app.
- **src/index.css**: Global styles for the app.
